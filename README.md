A simulation of natural selection using blobs on a 2d canvas.

Master is currently being used to transition from pygame to Qt so do not attempt to run it as it will not function correctly.

To get a demo of the project, clone the pygame branch, install the requirements using Python and run python main.py.

`config.json` contains all tweakable parameters for the simulation. Please contact me for details on what they do.
